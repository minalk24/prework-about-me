      <p>I am a UI developer with a years of industry experience in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I worked in India for a company called BanTec software. I always wanted to expand my skill set and to learn other related technologies and be the Master of Full Stack. I am applying for this class as it covers the technologies I am interested in along with the practical approach. I am also looking forward to build applications, networking and a job(after the bootcamp), which I feel, will be achieved though this Bootcamp.</p>
